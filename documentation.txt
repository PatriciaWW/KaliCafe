4.	Implementation of CRAP
The C.R.A.P. (Consistency, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity) principles are essential for ensuring a well-structured, user-friendly, and visually appealing system. Below is how these principles have been applied in our project:
4.1.	Consistency
•	The design follows a uniform color scheme, typography, and layout across all pages.
•	UI components such as buttons, input fields, and navigation bars maintain a standard style, ensuring a predictable user experience.
•	Code follows a consistent naming convention for variables, functions, and file structures to improve readability and maintainability.
4.2.	Repetition
•	Common UI elements, such as headers, footers, and sidebars, are repeated across different views to create familiarity.
•	The codebase uses modular components and reusable functions to avoid redundancy and maintain efficiency.
•	Error handling follows a standardized message format, ensuring users receive uniform feedback across different sections of the application.
4.3.	Alignment
•	All UI elements are carefully aligned to ensure a clean and structured look, enhancing usability.
•	Forms, buttons, and text blocks follow a grid system, improving readability and reducing clutter.
•	In the codebase, indentation and spacing follow standardized formatting guidelines to ensure readability and maintainability.
4.4.	Proximity
•	Related elements, such as labels and input fields, are grouped together for better usability.
•	Navigation links and action buttons are positioned close to the content they affect, minimizing user effort.
•	In the backend, related functions and modules are kept within the same directory structure to enhance organization and maintainability.
5.	Conclusion
The Kali Cafe webpage provides a visually appealing and functional cafe website.
With a structured layout, clean navigation, and interactive features, it creates an engaging experience for visitors by applying the CRAP principles thus ensuring the project maintains a user-friendly and professional appearance while at the same time enhancing code maintainability and readability.
